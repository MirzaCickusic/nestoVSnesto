CHECK OUT THE LIVE SITE: https://nestovsnesto.space/

I come from Bosnia and Herzegovina so I used our native lenguage to build this site. 

It is a web site builded upon [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework and I used Firebase for hosting the site and storing data..

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.
